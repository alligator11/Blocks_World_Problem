# Blocks_World_Problem
The problem is solved using Hill Climbing and Best first search algorithm. 
Two types of heuristic functions are used -
1. Add 1 for every block that is on the correct block/table. Subtract 1 for every block on a wrong block/table.
2. Add n if a block is on a correct structure of n blocks. Subtract n if block is on the wrong structure of n blocks.
